# 🕹️ ruNESco 🎮

An emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) written in Rust, which supports cooperative online multiplayer over any modern web browser using Web Assembly, and peer-to-peer communication through Matchbox. 

The idea for ruNESco started during the lockdown with a personal fascination with emulators and playing retro games, along with constantly looking for free multiplayer games to play together in that period.

##### Rust 🦀
Rust is an excellent programming language for emulation, as it allows for
- Enhanced performance, allowing for faster emulation
- Memory safety, allowing for ease in debugging and preventing potential errors before they can occur
- Concurrency, crucial for emulation of parallel tasks on a single CPU, as well as for minimal latency for multiplayer 
##### Web Assembly 🕸️
WebAssembly is a assembly-like language with near-native performance and provides a language like Rust a compilation target so that it can run on the web. This would allow crossplay between any platform with a modern browser, preventing having to ensure compability between operating systems.
##### Matchbox 🔥
Matchbox is a rust based tool which allows users to use peer-to-peer WebRTC (Web Real-Time-Communication) networking for rust's native and wasm applications, in order to facilitate low-latency game.
